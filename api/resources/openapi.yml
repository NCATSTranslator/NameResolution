  description: 'Name resolution service<p/>This service takes lexical strings and attempts to map them to identifiers
    (curies) from a vocabulary or ontology.  The lookup is not exact, but includes partial matches.<p/>
     Multiple results may be returned representing possible conceptual matches, but all of the identifiers
     have been correctly normalized using the <a href="https://nodenormalization-sri.renci.org>NodeNormalization
