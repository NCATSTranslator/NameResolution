## New features
* Solr database now has two additional fields for each clique:
  * `taxa`: list of taxa that a clique is found in; in Babel 2024mar24, only NCBIGenes have taxa (as generated by
    [TranslatorSRI/Babel#211](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/211)).
  * `clique_identifier_count`: the number of identifiers in this clique (as generated by
    [TranslatorSRI/Babel#228](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/228)).
* The `/lookup` endpoints now return `taxa` and `clique_identifier_count`. They also have an `only_taxa` filter that
  can be used to provide a pipe-delimited list of NCBITaxon entries to filter results with.
