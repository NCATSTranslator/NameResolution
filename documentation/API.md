# Name Resolver API

The Name Resolver API is intended to provide an [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/)-based interface to the
[Babel](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel) cliques of equivalent identifiers. Apache Solr is a document-based search engine:
the documents in this case are descriptions of cliques as generated by the
[Babel](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel) pipeline in its
[Synonyms format](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel/blob/master/docs/DataFormats.md#synonym-files), including lists of all known synonyms.
Here is an example document for [NCBIGene:1756](https://name-resolution-sri.renci.org/synonyms?preferred_curies=NCBIGene%3A1756)
(compared with the same CURIE [on NodeNorm](https://nodenormalization-sri.renci.org/get_normalized_nodes?curie=NCBIGene:1756)):

The Name Resolver largely consists of two [search endpoints](#search-endpoints): `/lookup` (to search for normalized concepts),
`/bulk-lookup` (to search for multiple normalized concepts), and one [lookup endpoint](#lookup-endpoints):
`/synonyms` (to look up for the synonyms for a normalized CURIE).

## Conflation

Unlike the Node Normalizer, the Name Resolution Service does not currently support on-the-fly conflation. Instead,
all the [Babel conflations](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel/blob/master/docs/Conflation.md) are turned on when Solr database is built. At the moment, this includes:
* GeneProtein conflation: protein-encoding genes are conflated with the protein(s) they encode, and the gene identifier
  is used to identify this concept. Therefore, if you search for ""
* DrugChemical conflation: drugs are conflated with their active ingredient, and the identifier for the active ingredient
  is used to identify this concept.
This means that -- for example -- protein-encoding genes will include the synonyms found
for the protein they encode, and that no separate entry will be available for those proteins.

Once you have an identifier from Name Resolver, you can use the [Node Normalizer](https://nodenormalization-sri.renci.org/)
to look up the equivalent identifiers for that CURIE with and without conflation. Please use the Node Normalizer
corresponding to the instance of Name Resolver you are using.

We are currently working on supporting
[on-the-fly conflation](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/NameResolution/issues/224) in Name Resolver.

## Search endpoints

The search endpoints allow you to search for concepts by a fragment of a name or synonym. These endpoints use Solr's extended Dismax query parser to search for matches across preferred names and synonyms, with support for highlighting, filtering, pagination, and debugging.

### `/lookup`

Search for cliques by a fragment of a name or synonym.

**Endpoint:** `GET /lookup` or `POST /lookup`

**Parameters:**

- `string` (required, string): The string to search for.
- `autocomplete` (optional, boolean, default: false): If `true`, treats the input string as incomplete and looks for terms that start with the final word. If `false`, treats the entire phrase as complete (entity linker mode).
- `highlighting` (optional, boolean, default: false): If `true`, returns information on which labels and synonyms matched the search query.
- `offset` (optional, integer, default: 0, minimum: 0): The number of results to skip. Used for pagination.
- `limit` (optional, integer, default: 10, minimum: 0, maximum: 1000): The maximum number of results to return. Used for pagination.
- `biolink_type` (optional, list of strings): Filter results to specific Biolink types. Types can be specified with or without the `biolink:` prefix (e.g., `biolink:Disease` or `Disease`). Multiple types are combined with OR logic, so filtering for `PhenotypicFeature` and `Disease` will return concepts that are either phenotypic features OR diseases.
- `only_prefixes` (optional, string): Pipe-separated, case-sensitive list of CURIE prefixes to include (e.g., `MONDO|EFO`). Only results with matching prefixes will be returned.
- `exclude_prefixes` (optional, string): Pipe-separated, case-sensitive list of CURIE prefixes to exclude (e.g., `UMLS|EFO`). Results with matching prefixes will be filtered out.
- `only_taxa` (optional, string): Pipe-separated, case-sensitive list of taxa to filter to (e.g., `NCBITaxon:9606|NCBITaxon:10090|NCBITaxon:10116|NCBITaxon:7955`). Results without a specified taxon or with a matching taxon will be included.
- `debug` (optional, string, one of: `none`, `query`, `timing`, `results`, `all`, default: `none`): Return debugging information from the underlying Solr query. See [Solr debug documentation](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/query-guide/common-query-parameters.html#debug-parameter) for details.

**Returns:** A list of `LookupResult` objects, each containing:
- `curie`: The CURIE of the concept.
- `label`: The preferred name of the concept.
- `highlighting`: An object with `labels` and `synonyms` arrays showing which matches were found (only included if `highlighting=true`).
- `synonyms`: A list of all known synonyms for this concept.
- `score`: The Solr search score for this result.
- `taxa`: A list of taxa associated with this concept.
- `types`: A list of Biolink types for this concept (prefixed with `biolink:`).
- `clique_identifier_count`: The number of identifiers in this clique.
- `explain`: Explanation of the score for this result (only included if `debug` is `results` or `all`).
- `debug`: Debugging information for the entire query (only included if `debug` is not `none`). To avoid duplication, explains within this structure will be replaced with a `{"_comment": "..."}`.
  - `timing`: Providing timing information for the Solr query (only included if `debug` is `timing` or `all`).
  - `parsedquery`: The parsed query string (only included if `debug` is `query` or `all`).

**Example requests:**

GET request to search for "diabetes":
```
GET /lookup?string=diabetes&limit=5
```

POST request to search for "cancer" with filters:
```
POST /lookup?string=cancer&biolink_type=Disease&only_prefixes=MONDO&limit=10
```

GET request with autocomplete enabled:
```
GET /lookup?string=dmd&autocomplete=true&highlighting=true
```

**Notes:**
- CURIEs are conflated with both GeneProtein and DrugChemical conflation. For example, when searching for a protein, the identifier of the gene that encodes the protein may also be returned. See the [Conflation section](#conflation) for more information.
- Search results are sorted by score (descending), then by clique identifier count (descending), then by CURIE suffix (ascending).

### `/bulk-lookup`

Search for cliques for multiple strings in a single request.

**Endpoint:** `POST /bulk-lookup`

**Request body:** A JSON object with a `NameResQuery` structure:

```json
{
  "strings": ["diabetes", "cancer"],
  "autocomplete": false,
  "highlighting": false,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10,
  "biolink_types": [],
  "only_prefixes": "",
  "exclude_prefixes": "",
  "only_taxa": "",
  "debug": "none"
}
```

**Parameters:** Same as `/lookup`, except:
- `strings` (required, list of strings): A list of strings to search for. The returned results will be in a dictionary with these values as keys.
- All other parameters are optional and apply to all searches.

**Returns:** A dictionary where each key is a string from the input `strings` array, and each value is a list of `LookupResult` objects (same structure as `/lookup` results).

**Example request:**

POST `/bulk-lookup` with body:

```json
{
  "strings": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "asthma"],
  "limit": 5,
  "biolink_types": ["Disease"]
}
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "diabetes": [
    {
      "curie": "MONDO:0005148",
      "label": "diabetes mellitus",
      "highlighting": {},
      "synonyms": ["diabetes", ...],
      "score": 42.5,
      "taxa": [],
      "types": ["biolink:Disease", ...],
      "clique_identifier_count": 125
    },
    ...
  ],
  "hypertension": [...],
  "asthma": [...]
}
```

**Notes:**
- This endpoint is useful for batch processing multiple queries at once, which can be more efficient than making multiple `/lookup` requests.
- All results for a given string share the same filter and search parameters.

## Lookup endpoints

The lookup endpoints allow you to retrieve all synonyms and information for a known CURIE (concept unique resource identifier). Unlike the search endpoints, these do not perform text matching; they retrieve data for exact CURIEs.

### `/synonyms`

Look up all synonyms and information for a CURIE.

**Endpoint:** `GET /synonyms` or `POST /synonyms`

**Parameters:**

- `preferred_curies` (required, list of strings): A list of CURIEs to look up synonyms for. You can normalize a CURIE to a preferred CURIE using [NodeNorm](https://nodenormalization-sri.renci.org/).

**Returns:** A dictionary where each key is a CURIE from the input list, and each value is a document object containing:
- `curie`: The CURIE identifier.
- `preferred_name`: The preferred name for this concept.
- `names`: A list of all known synonyms for this concept.
- `types`: A list of Biolink types for this concept.
- `taxa`: A list of taxa associated with this concept.
- `clique_identifier_count`: The number of identifiers in this clique.
- Additional metadata fields such as `curie_suffix`, `id`, and `_version_`.

**Example requests:**

GET request to look up a single CURIE:
```
GET /synonyms?preferred_curies=NCBIGene:1756
```

GET request to look up multiple CURIEs:
```
GET /synonyms?preferred_curies=MONDO:0005148&preferred_curies=NCBIGene:1756
```

POST /synonyms with body:
```json
{
  "preferred_curies": ["MONDO:0005148", "NCBIGene:1756"]
}
```

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "MONDO:0005148": {
    "curie": "MONDO:0005148",
    "preferred_name": "diabetes mellitus",
    "names": ["diabetes mellitus", "diabetes", "DM", ...],
    "types": ["Disease", "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature", ...],
    "taxa": [],
    "clique_identifier_count": 125,
    ...
  },
  "NCBIGene:1756": {
    "curie": "NCBIGene:1756",
    "preferred_name": "DMD",
    "names": ["DMD", "dystrophin", "BMD", ...],
    "types": ["Gene", "GeneOrGeneProduct", ...],
    "taxa": ["NCBITaxon:9606"],
    "clique_identifier_count": 22,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- This endpoint provides a complete view of all synonyms and properties for a given concept.
- CURIEs are conflated with both GeneProtein and DrugChemical conflation. For example, when looking up a protein CURIE, the synonyms for the gene that encodes the protein will also be included. See the [Conflation section](#conflation) for more information.
- If a CURIE is not found in the database, it will still appear in the response dictionary with an empty object as its value.
- For large batches of CURIEs, consider using this endpoint instead of making individual requests, as it is optimized for batch lookups.

## Health endpoints
