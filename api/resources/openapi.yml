  description: 'Name Resolution/Name Lookup service<p/>This service takes lexical strings and attempts to map them to identifiers
    (CURIEs) from a vocabulary or ontology.  The lookup is not exact, but includes partial matches.<p/>
     Multiple results may be returned representing possible conceptual matches, but all of the identifiers
     have been correctly normalized using the
     <a href="https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NodeNormalization">Node Normalization</a> service.'
