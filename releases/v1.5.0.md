# NameRes v1.5.0 Release
- Babel: [2025sep1](https://stars.renci.org/var/babel_outputs/2025sep1/)
  ([Babel 2025sep1](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/blob/master/releases/2025sep1.md))
- NameRes: [v1.5.0](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
Next release: _None as yet_
Previous release: [NameRes v1.4.7](./v1.4.7.md)

## Bugfixes
- [MAJOR] Entries with clique_identifier_count=1 were being filtered out of search results because we were boosting
  with the log of clique_identifier_count, and log(1) = 0. This has now been fixed by using the log of
  (clique_identifier_count + 1). ([PR #179](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/179))
- Fixed bug in NameRes Loading Docker image generation (d3f607af95e3fb254298d7f0a637a63ccb63fd6b).

## New Features
- [MAJOR] This NameRes has GeneProtein conflation turned on. If you need to know the protein and gene identifiers for
  a particular NameRes result, you can normalize the identifier with the corresponding NodeNorm instance with
  `individual_types` set to true ([example](https://nodenormalization-sri.renci.org/1.5/get_normalized_nodes?curie=NCBIGene%3A1756&conflate=true&drug_chemical_conflate=false&description=false&individual_types=true)).
- Added Babel version and version URL to the `/status` endpoint ([PR #180](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/180)).
- Added instructions and script for running NameRes locally ([PR #186](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/186)).

## Improvements
- [MAJOR] Update exact boosts ([PR #183](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/183)).
  - Exactish (case-insensitive exact) matches are now boosted by ~100x non-exactish matches.
  - Increased the basic boost by ~10x so that they override low clique_identifier_count matches.
- Updated curl to use -T instead of -d to upload file in data-loading ([PR #183](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/197)).
- Fix start-end quotes bug (i.e. "smart" quotes) ([PR #179](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/NameResolution/pull/179)).

## Babel updates (from [Babel 2025sep1](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/blob/master/releases/2025sep1.md))
- [MAJOR] Information content values were incorrectly calculated as `100` for some cliques when they were in fact lower.
- [MAJOR] UMLS proteins have now been removed from chemicals so that they only appear in proteins.
- [MAJOR] Improved DrugChemical conflation order.
- [MAJOR] Added secondary identifiers for ChEBI.
