## New features
* Solr database now has two additional fields for each clique:
  * `taxa`: list of taxa that a clique is found in; in Babel 2024mar24, only NCBIGenes have taxa (as generated by
    [TranslatorSRI/Babel#211](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/211)).
  * `clique_identifier_count`: the number of identifiers in this clique (as generated by
    [TranslatorSRI/Babel#228](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/228)).
* The `/lookup` endpoints now return `taxa` and `clique_identifier_count`. They also have an `only_taxa` filter that
  can be used to provide a pipe-delimited list of NCBITaxon entries to filter results with.

## Babel updates (from Babel Translator May 2024 Release)
* [New identifiers] 36.9 million PubMed IDs (e.g. `PMID:25061375`) have been added as `biolink:JournalArticle`, as well as
  the mappings to PMC (e.g. `PMC:PMC4109484`) and DOIs (e.g. `doi:10.3897/zookeys.420.7089`) that are included in PubMed.
  Details in [TranslatorSRI/Babel#227](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/227).
* Fixed type determination for DrugChemical conflation. Details in
  [TranslatorSRI/Babel#266](https://github.com/TranslatorSRI/Babel/pull/266).
* Synonym files now include the clique identifier count (the number of identifiers in each clique) in synonyms file.
* Minor fixes.
